MR🌐Tracker - track anything, anytime

The Ultimate Solution for Tracking Anything, Anywhere in the World.

MR🌐Tracker is a cutting-edge tracking solution, meticulously engineered to monitor the location of a diverse range of assets. From cruises, letters and packages to luggage, vehicles, keys, backpacks, bicycles, and construction equipment – we've got you covered. Whether you're a traveler, a professional, or simply looking to safeguard your belongings, our advanced technology offers comprehensive oversight, providing the peace of mind you deserve.
Simply decide what you want to track, attach a tag, and you're good to go – it's that simple.

Our typical application setup includes a MacBook computer, iPhone, and 32 FindMy-compatible Bluetooth tags, running as a franchise at your site. We handle all the necessary software installation, network setup, and offer remote support for a nominal charge. Rest assured about data privacy – all data uses SSL encryption, ensuring your information remains secure. Reports are accessible only to you as an admin, and you can grant access to additional users with user IDs chosen by you as the admin.

The tags record locations worldwide with no SIM charges, utilizing iCloud to communicate their position by pinging off other iPhones. The tag batteries (CR2032) are known to work for up to a year before needing replacing. You will get alerts well ahead of that requirement so you don't lose any location data.

If that's not enough MR🌐Tracker also does full inventory management, auction tracking and package tracking of your inventory, a fully integrated system, ideal for your Facebook coin, notes or precious metals side-hustle sales.
